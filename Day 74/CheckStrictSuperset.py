'''
You are given a set and other sets.
Your job is to find whether set is a strict superset of each of the

sets.

Print True, if
is a strict superset of each of the

sets. Otherwise, print False.

A strict superset has at least one element that does not exist in its subset.

Example
Set
is a strict superset of set.
Set is not a strict superset of set.
Set is not a strict superset of set

.

Input Format

The first line contains the space separated elements of set
.
The second line contains integer , the number of other sets.
The next

lines contains the space separated elements of the other sets.

Constraints

Output Format

Print True if set
is a strict superset of all other

sets. Otherwise, print False.

Sample Input 0

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 23 45 84 78
